# Civil Engineering and Architecture class Sep 2022

This is a project I made in class.
Finished on Sep 22. Using a hand soldered strip of random WS2812 led boards connected to an arduino Nano. The project is powered over the Nano's USB port, LEDs connected directly to the 5v pin on the Nano.

One button is connected between A2 and A4. The LEDs data is connected to pin 5. There are 7 LEDs.

The parking lot itself is made of foam board, cardboard, popsicle sticks, a wooden dowel, and hot glue.
